# Documentation Generation Tool with GPT 4 Turbo!

This uses the beta thread and assistant features of the official [openai node API](https://github.com/openai/openai-node). See [Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants)

For global usage:
`npm i -g gptdocwriter`

Then, from your desired folder:
`gptdocwriter --initialFiles index.js,utils.js --extensions .js,.jsx --excluded dist,node_modules --model gpt-4-1106-preview`

entryPoint defaults to current working directory

The various command line arguments include:

- `--apiKey`: Your OpenAI API key (e.g. `sk-abcdefg`). Treat this like your diary‚Äîpersonal and private.
- `--initialFiles`: Comma-separated list of startup files (e.g. `utils.js,gptdocument.js`).
- `--excluded`: Comma-separated list of paths to be excluded from documentation (e.g. `server.js,node_modules,dist`).
- `--extensions`: Comma-separated list of file extensions to include in the documentation (e.g. `js,ts,tsx,jsx`).
- `--model`: The model of GPT to use (e.g. `gpt-4-turbo-1106`).
- `--cleanup`: Boolean flag to clean up anything afterward. Probably leftover "documentation" pizza boxes.
- `--extraInstructions`: Additional instructions for usage clarification (e.g. "Make sure you specifically list the input arguments for the cli").
- `--name`: Name of the project to document (e.g. `gptdocwriter`).


inputs listed are defaults.

Set API Key (saved to the library folder (keep private!!) in config.txt)

`gptdocwriter --apiKey sk-abcdefg`

Or set in utils.js and execute this locally via `node gptdocument.js xxx`

Or module usage:
```js 

import {generateDocumentation} from 'gptdocwriter'

// CLI usage to call generateDocumentation
generateDocumentation(
    process.cwd(), 
    ['utils.js'],  //scan the rest of the files after this specified order is completed
    ['.js', '.ts', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.tsx'], 
    ['dist','node_modules']
);

```

The prompt for all of this is experimental so tweak it as you need.

See a repo where I applied this to a fairly hefty codebase: [JS Maze Generator with A* solver](https://github.com/joshbrew/JS-Maze-Generator-with-A-Star-Solver/tree/main/documentation)

GPT generated docs below, with extra instructions to use strict iambic pentameter:

- Generated with: `node gptdocument.js --excluded server.js,node_modules,dist --initialFiles utils.js,package.json --cleanup --extraInstructions Write everything in iambic pentameter without exception.`
