# Documentation Generation Tool with GPT 4 Turbo!

This uses the beta thread and assistant features of the official [openai node API](https://github.com/openai/openai-node). See [Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants)

For global usage:
`npm i -g gptdocwriter`

Then, from your desired folder:
`gptdocwriter --initialFiles index.js,utils.js --extensions .js,.jsx --excluded dist,node_modules --model gpt-4-1106-preview`

entryPoint defaults to current working directory

## Features

- Set an API key for authenticating with the OpenAI API.
- Generate documentation based on specified entry points, file types, and other criteria.
- Exclude certain files or directories from being documented.
- Define custom models, output formats, and additional instructions for the AI to follow.

## Usage

The various command line arguments include. Combine as needed. Call --apiKey first.

```bash
# Set the API key for OpenAI services
gptdocwriter --apiKey sk-abcdefg

# Generate documentation for specific files and crawl others
gptdocwriter --initialFiles utils.js,gptdocument.js

# Exclude files or directories from being documented
gptdocwriter --excluded server.js,node_modules,dist

# Specify which file extensions to include in the documentation
gptdocwriter --extensions js,ts,tsx,jsx

# Choose the GPT-4 model variant to use
gptdocwriter --model gpt-4-turbo-1106

# Tidy up after generating documentation
gptdocwriter --cleanup

# Tailor the prompt for the AI instead of the default prompt
gptdocwriter --instructions Write detailed documentation about each file

# Include additional specific instructions
gptdocwriter --extraInstructions Mention the CLI input arguments

# Specify the project name within the readme
gptdocwriter --name gptdocwriter

# Change the output format to another extension than .md, e.g. we could transpose files from one programming language to another 
gptdocwriter --outputFormat .py

# Adjust the readme content template
gptdocwriter --readme Summarize this in a digestible format for folks who got a D in English
```

Set API Key (saved to the library folder (keep private!!) in config.txt)

`gptdocwriter --apiKey sk-abcdefg`

Or set in utils.js and execute this locally via `node gptdocument.js xxx`

Or module usage:
```js 

import {generateDocumentation} from 'gptdocwriter'

// CLI usage to call generateDocumentation
generateDocumentation(
    process.cwd(), 
    ['utils.js'],  //scan the rest of the files after this specified order is completed
    ['.js', '.ts', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.tsx'], 
    ['dist','node_modules']
);

```

The prompt for all of this is experimental so tweak it as you need.

See a repo where I applied this to a fairly hefty codebase: [JS Maze Generator with A* solver](https://github.com/joshbrew/JS-Maze-Generator-with-A-Star-Solver/tree/main/documentation)

GPT generated docs below, with extra instructions to use strict iambic pentameter:

- Generated with: `node gptdocument.js --excluded server.js,node_modules,dist --initialFiles utils.js,package.json --cleanup --extraInstructions Write everything in iambic pentameter without exception.`

# GPTDocWriter :bookmark_tabs: :sparkles:

Embrace the muse of documentation, where prose is paired with code,
A repository enriched with AI, a doc-gen tool abode.
GPTDocWriter wields the pen of GPT-4's might,
To craft the docs that shadow software, bringing its logic to light.
