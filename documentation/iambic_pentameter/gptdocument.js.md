## Overview

Behold now, `gptdocument.js`, the guide,
That charts a course through source code, far and wide.
A script designed to activate with speed,
To document oneself is its creed.

## The Essence of gptdocument.js

In this here script, where arguments convene,
`generateDocumentation` takes the scene.
From `./utils.js` 'tis import drawn,
And hence the documentation's dawn.

## CLI Arguments Transformation

Converting args that passed as strings do lie,
To arrays indeed, with eagle's eye.
Should `apiKey` be set, 'twill note it down,
In library's heart, where settings are found.

But if instead, parameters are plenty,
With `extensions`, `initialFiles`, not empty,
Then `generateDocumentation` shall begin,
And through the codebase it will deftly spin.

## Example Commands

To run this script, with CLI command,
Set `apiKey` first, at forefront stand.

Combine then arguments as ye may,
And run the script without delay.
Pass entry points, exclude, and files of yore,
Set models, clear states, do so much more.

## Generating Documentation

One can, with ease, tell which files to crown,
Select extensions, directories down.
Specify if models shall leave or stay,
Or how the output format shall display.

## Final Verse 

Here ends our tale of `gptdocument.js`,
A simple use, no need to vex.
In lines of ten with beats that five do hold,
We've recounted tales of source code, bold.
