# Utils.js Documentation

Oh gentle reader, pray attend and lend
Thy mind to gain what knowledge here shall wend.
Herein described, a module stands revealed,
To automate and traverse code's vast field.

### Overview

In `utils.js`, a purpose served with vim,
To parse commands and set configurations trim.
With OpenAI's grand gears it doth entwine,
And executes instructions so divine.

## Installation and Usage

Include this in thy noble script's array,
And import thusly, without shades of gray:

```javascript
import { getArgs, setConfig, getConfig, ask, generateDocumentation } from './utils.js';
```

The secrets held within thy `utils.js` heart,
Await to play their fundamentally crucial part.
The configurations, parsing command line knaves,
They ready scripts for tasks that developers crave.

## Configuration Management

### `setConfig(apiKey, assistantId, threadId)`

This function doth write unto a file
The settings for thy API, sans guile.
It checks if current settings do exist,
And updates them or strikes them from the list.

### `getConfig()`

Retrieve the configs from the disk with ease,
Return an object, or empty if it please.

## Command Line Arguments

### `getArgs(args = process.argv)`

Used for interpreting the script's behest,
From CLI it builds an argument nest.
Employ it thus to find the keys and pacts,
To tell thy code just how it should react.

## GPT Interaction

### `ask(options)`

Prosper, dear user, and to GPT-4 speak,
It takes a prompt, then waits for AI to squeak.
Crucial effusions in communication's threads,
Yield answers from the model's knowing heads.

## Documentation Procedures

### `generateReadme(entryPoint, threadId)`

Inscribe a `README.md`, full robust,
With content rich that earns the reader's trust.
Ensconce at `entryPoint` as you'd design,
To guide all souls who in your code do mine.

### `generateDocumentation(entryPath, initialFiles, fileExtensions, excluded, extraInstructions)`

A task most arduous, 'tis documented code,
From starting files, through paths and branches strode.
Neglect what's spurned, embrace the files in scope,
And write each document with skill and hope.

## Model Configuration

Observe the `model` variable's scope,
For 'tis the AI for which you dare to grope.
From 'gpt-3.5-turbo' to the '4-preview',
Choose well the intellect that complements you.

## Utility in Action

The functions here doth make a toolbelt grand,
For scripting documentation across the land.
Invoke these in thy splendid automation's tale,
To spin a doc that's clear, without fail.

With OpenAI's partnership, your deeds enshrine,
The spark of knowledge in a framework, oh so fine.
Prepare to have your codebase documented,
Perchance improved, with wisdom augmented.
```

Apply these in thy scripts with great accord,
And let the utils aid thee, like a sword.
Dispatch thy commands and unwrap their might,
To ease the scribbling in the dev's long night.

**Note**: The bardic code above doth need environment up with `node.js` set, and `fs` plus `path` modules met. The OpenAI library, too, must be present; install with care, and use it prudent.
