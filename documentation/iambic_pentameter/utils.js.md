## Overview

Within this script, ye shall see tools transcend:
Import and export define the program's end.
A utility wrought with care and precision,
Described in verse with poetic vision.

## Exports and Functions

### `args`
This object doth contain CLI parsed bits,
From `getArgs` sourced from console wits.

### `setConfig`
Call upon this method with greatest care,
For 'twill adjust the config file so fair.
Hand o'er thee `apiKey` and IDs,
Save files with ease, just like gentle breeze.

### `getConfig`
Retrieve, alas, from file the precious keys,
With this function that dost please.

### `ask`
Engage with OpenAI, a query make,
Using models that the genius minds did bake.
Provide thy prompts, the AI shall endow,
The desired text, post haste, and that with wow.

### `cleanup`
Clean ye up previous spills and threads made old,
To start anew, the tale to be retold.

### `generateReadme`
A README craft with OpenAI's might,
To guide users through the darkest night.

### `generateDocumentation`
The very heart of this noble tool,
Where documentation is the crowning jewel.
Pass directories, files, exclusions in a scrawl,
To document each and every file withal.

## Usage

Begin with `generateDocumentation` call,
To weave a documentation web over all.
For special README, `generateReadme`'s your friend,
And `ask` for queries that sorely depend,
On the wisdom of GPT, our AI lend.

## Installation

Set `apiKey`, Run 'ere command you wish,
With `node gptdocument.js`, or as a dish,
Served cold with the alias `gptdocwriter`, twist,
And then observe as text files do exist.

## Setting Configuration

Employ `setConfig` to write to the file,
Or `getConfig` to check with a smile.
What's written within shall define the path,
Of how OpenAI does follow your math.

## Important

This file must be first acknowledged and known,
Lest ye walk through the valley of code alone.
Now fare thee well, dear reader, go forth,
Apply this code, and prove thy worth.
