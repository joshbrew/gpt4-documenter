# Utils.js

In fair JavaScript's depth where we lay our scene,
You'll find some code, for tasks quite routine.
An engine, Utils.js, with functions to bind,
So sit you down, if documentation's the kind.

Importing modules comes first in this play,
`fs`, `path`, and `url`, in import's array.
From console utilities, we fetch with might,
`getArgs` and `colorText`, to use them just right.

An OpenAI key is oft kept quite near,
Set yours with care, 'fore CLI you steer.
Commands aplenty, the comments reveal,
Options for usage, appeal do they feel.

A GPT doc writer, so clever, so sleek,
Configures at will, the generation technique.
Choose initial files or a working dir nest,
Exclude some, include rest, set OpenAI to test.

Of models to choose, you'll be quite fond,
Be it `gpt-3.5` or `gpt-4` beyond.
Clear the thread, keep content, adjust your rate limit,
Instructions in prompt for the AI's generated snippet.

Whether verbose in `.md` or shy in `.py`,
The output conforms, do give it a try.
Set API keys, let assistants be born,
To generate docs to which others are sworn.

Commence with an ask, await with good cheer,
For OpenAI's wisdom to appear.
Prompt your request, may it be quite profound,
Await the response, where knowledge is found.

If your assistant slows or you wish not delay,
Clean up with a function that clears threads away.
And perhaps youâ€™ll need to configure anew,
Set API keys for assistants in view.

By getConfig we summon, what's previously stored,
API key, Assistant ID, not to be ignored.
Then document each file, with recursive grace,
Excluding the unwanted, keeping a steady pace.

Generate Readme with flair and with style,
The opening pitch, to engage for a while.
Document and read, write functions so smart,
Utils.js in essence, a critical part.

Yet heed now the twist, for 'tis iambic we're bound,
In pentameter verse, our documentation's sound.
So use this module, its purpose won't tire,
For generating docs is what you require.
