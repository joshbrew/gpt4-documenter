# The `package.json` File Overview

In our noble code, `package.json` stands,
Defining the project 'gptdocwriter's bands.
With metadata rich, and settings defined,
For nodular scripts that are well-combined.

## Project Details

- `name`: gptdocwriter's source,
- `version`: point five, our course,
- `description`: with prose quite engaging,
  Turbo-powered docs, forever paging.

## Main Entry Point

The heart of our code, `./utils.js`,
Where algorithms run and processes bless.

## Module Type Declared

Declared as a module for modern flair,
ES6 imports we thus declare.

## Executable Bin

This `bin` holds the file `gptdocwriter`,
Named after our project, can't be tighter.
Run with `npx` or add to global sphere,
To execute as a command that's clear.

## Scripts

Our scripts, they run with great precision:
- `start`: fires the app with vision,
- `init`: runs a build that's tiny,
- `concurrent`: sets tasks not whiney,
- `dev`: prepares for a dev session,
- `startdev`: watches for your progression,
- `python`: our server, it will sway,
- `pip`: ensures packages installed today,
- `pwa`: installs for offline scope,
  Runs `workbox-cli`, we do hope.

## Project Keywords

Just one keyword stands, `esbuild` is it,
For fast bundling, that's a perfect hit.

## Author and License

Both yet unfilled, a blank canvas they wait,
The author and license we might debate.

## Nodemon Configuration

For development's friend, `nodemonConfig` bounds,
Ignores `dist/`, `.temp/` in rounds,
Environment vars set for us to behold,
`NODEMON`: true, as it does unfold.

## Dependencies Enlisted

Just one for now, the `openai` prize,
Version four point seventeen point four in size.

Thus ends our verse on this JSON file,
A guide well versed, no need for trial.
Save these words close to your chest,
In gptdocwriter's docs, they manifest.
