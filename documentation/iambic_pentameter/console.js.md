## Overview of console.js

Let's venture forth to `console.js`, where hues,
Are defined and shaped for messages we use.
Commands parsed with care to map our quest,
Now let's recite this code in verses dressed.

## Colors Const Object

### Finite colors
Anon, an object called `colors` holds,
The ansi codes which console foretold.
Reset, bright, and dim, and underscore,
Colors for fore, background, there is more.

### Foreground set
Including, lo, the black to white-beguiled,
In `fg` nested, for text styled.

### Background tints
Now, in `bg`, backgrounds lay impressed,
With similar shades, text hath addressed.

## The Function: colorText

To paint one's words in hues bold or pale,
Invoke `colorText`, see color prevail.
Pass text and color, the function doth bind,
The given hue, 'till reset leaves behind.

## getArgs Function

Parses CLI, an argument maze
Extracting values in a myriad ways
With dashes and equals, the function doth seek
To map keys to values, both strong and meek.

## Using These Functions

In order to change the terminal's visage,
One may call `colorText` to leverage,
The terminal's colors, to print bold or hide,
Or reverse, blink, underscore side by side.

To parse arguments from the command line,
Use `getArgs`, turn strings to values fine.
It handles with grace, the input array,
Returning a map, much to your array.

## Conclusion

Thus we've unfolded `console.js` lore,
In iambic verse, but wait, there's more.
As thou proceed in your noble code tour,
Remember these functions open the door,
To colorful logs and command line parse,
With elegance, thy scripts they shall endorse.
