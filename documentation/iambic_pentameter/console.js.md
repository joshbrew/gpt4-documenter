# Console.js

Attend all developers with earnest intent,
To document code in verse is now our event.
Console.js, a simple module file,
As aide to color and parse, it brings a smile.

Exported constants define we to start,
Colors for console, a text-styling art.
Reset, and bright, dim, underscore all,
Blink, reverse and hidden, on these we shall call.

Foreground blessings, a rainbow of text,
Black, red, green and more, to color context.
Background counterparts follow in tow,
Matched in hues, in console they glow.

Next, to colorize text, a function so clear,
`colorText` takes string and color, no fear.
Combined with the color, the text given life,
Returned with reset, to end the vibrant strife.

And what of command line arguments' fate,
To parse them in pairs, `getArgs` can't wait.
For flags prefixed with dashes, or key=value's ease,
In an object they're stored, to access with please.

Beware the lone keys, they stand in pride true,
Their value as true, acknowledged anew.
In dash-strewn arrays or spaces between,
This function lays all CLI arguments seen.

So take from this module, use colors with care,
And parse arguments smoothly, avoiding despair.
Console.js stands ready, to console and to parse,
In iambic pentameter, its abilities are vast.
