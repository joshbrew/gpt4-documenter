# Gptdocument.js

In lines where code meets command and plea,
A script, gptdocument.js, we now see.
A Node environment where the tool shall thrive,
For generating docs, makes our codebase alive.

Invoke with shebang, the Node interpreter's call,
To kickstart the process that shall not stall.
From utils.js import the functions, arms spread,
`generateDocumentation` and `args`, by which we're led.

Arguments first, from CLI parsed with care,
The API key, an entrance so fair:
If set, acknowledgment in console is cast,
Saved then to a library, secure and fast.

Extensions, initialFiles, paths to exclude,
Arrays they become, in solitude.
With no explicit settings, defaults come to play,
`.js`, `.ts`, and more, extensions hold sway.

Now to the heart, the document generator's thrust:
From the entry point given or the working directory, as just.
A crawl through the files, where documentation's keen,
Excluding what's redundant, the routine unseen.

The command line a guide, construct your call:
Set API key, entry point, model and all.
From the heavens, the GPT model selected,
Or leave to default, let the code be directed.

The developer's woes, their troubles to lessen,
Write, exclude, tailor prompts as a lesson.
Input and output, in formats you decree,
In the boats of code, set their structure free.

Arguments amassed, to the function fed,
The script churns and toils, until all is said.
Scribing documentation, a README too,
Embodied in tokens of code, ever anew.

Thus gptdocument.js, a script so composed,
In iambic pentameter, its usage disclosed.
Employ it, dear coder, let its virtues be known,
For in the sea of documentation, you're not alone.
