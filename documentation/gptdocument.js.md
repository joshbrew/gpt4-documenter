# GPTDocument.js - GPTDocWriter CLI

`gptdocument.js` is the command-line interface (CLI) executable for the GPTDocWriter project. This script allows users to invoke the documentation generation process through their terminal, providing various options to customize the output.

## Prerequisites

To run `gptdocument.js`, you need Node.js installed on your machine. The script is intended to run with Node, leveraging the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang at the top of the file, which finds and executes Node.js from your PATH.

## Installation

Before using the CLI, ensure that the `gptdocwriter` package is installed globally or in your project's `node_modules`. To install globally, you can use:

```sh
npm install -g gptdocwriter
```

## Usage

You execute `gptdocument.js` by running `gptdocwriter` from the command line, assuming it's installed globally, or using `npx` if it's installed locally. The script expects to receive CLI arguments to operate correctly—a divine gift to developers who love typing.

The various command line arguments include:

- `--apiKey`: Your OpenAI API key (e.g. `sk-abcdefg`). Treat this like your diary—personal and private.
- `--initialFiles`: Comma-separated list of startup files (e.g. `utils.js,gptdocument.js`).
- `--excluded`: Comma-separated list of paths to be excluded from documentation (e.g. `server.js,node_modules,dist`).
- `--extensions`: Comma-separated list of file extensions to include in the documentation (e.g. `js,ts,tsx,jsx`).
- `--model`: The model of GPT to use (e.g. `gpt-4-turbo-1106`).
- `--cleanup`: Boolean flag to clean up anything afterward. Probably leftover "documentation" pizza boxes.
- `--extraInstructions`: Additional instructions for usage clarification (e.g. "Make sure you specifically list the input arguments for the cli").
- `--name`: Name of the project to document (e.g. `gptdocwriter`).

For example, to generate documentation for `.js` and `.ts` files, excluding anything in `dist` and `node_modules`, and not mandating a cleanup afterwards, you'd type:

```sh
npx gptdocwriter --initialFiles utils.js,gptdocument.js --excluded dist,node_modules --extensions js,ts
```

Or, if you enjoy typing and procrastinating:

```sh
node gptdocument.js --apiKey sk-yourpersonalapikey --initialFiles myCode.js --excluded dist --extensions js
```

## Script Mechanics

The `gptdocument.js` script processes your arguments and gracefully sets defaults if you omit some (because yes, everyone needs a safety net). It then invokes the `generateDocumentation` function imported from the `utils.js` file with the appropriate arguments to kickstart the documentation generation process.

If you think about it, this script kind of feels like a telemarketer: it requires your input to start the conversation, but once it does—magic (or something less exciting depending on your view of autogenerated documentation).

## Conclusion

With `gptdocument.js`, your journey from "what the heck does this code do" to "ah, of course!" is but a CLI command away. It's like having a GPS for your code; it tells you where to go, but it's still on you not to drive into a lake.

Happy documenting, and may the odds be ever in your favor—or at least less odd than your original codebase.
