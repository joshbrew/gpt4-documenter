# `gptdocument.js`

`gptdocument.js` is the chief orchestrator of the `gptdocwriter` symphony. With the suave simplicity of a maestro's baton, it turns the cacophony of source files into a harmonious documentation concerto. When invoked, it meticulously follows the sheet music of command-line arguments, resulting in a transcendent performance of organized markdown files that speak volumes about your code.

## Shebang and Imports

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import {generateDocumentation, args} from './utils.js'
```

At the very top lies the *shebang*, which is not a sound effect from a retro Batman episode, but an instruction that tells the system this script should be run with Node.js. The import from `utils.js` includes the `generateDocumentation` function and the parsed `args` obtained from CLI arguments.

## CLI Configuration Handling

```javascript
if(args.apiKey) {
    console.log("Setting api key (saved to this library's install location)");
} else {
    // ... generateDocumentation call
}
```

If an `apiKey` is specified, the script acknowledges this and assures the user it will be memorized within the install location of the library. Anxiety about forgetting the API key is left at the doorstep; your secret is safe here.

## Generating Documentation

This part of the script is where the magic happens. Should the `apiKey` bit feel unnecessary (because maybe the script is trusting the library to know what it's doing), it gears up to generate documentation. It's like watching Mary Poppins tidy up a room — everything flies into its proper place, creating order from chaos:

```javascript
generateDocumentation(
    args.entryPoint ? args.entryPoint : process.cwd(), 
    args.initialFiles ? args.initialFiles : undefined, 
    args.extensions ? args.extensions : ['.js', '.ts', '.mjs', '.jsx', '.tsx'], 
    args.excluded ? args.excluded : ['dist','node_modules']
);
```

Each argument is dutifully passed into `generateDocumentation`, transforming strings into arrays where necessary, and filling in defaults for any stage fright amongst the CLI arguments.

## CLI Usage

The script concludes with a grand aria — a comprehensive comment enumerating the possibilities of CLI argument combinations. This repertoire is for those who fancy flexibility, allowing various selections to tailor the documentation generation process according to one's desires. It elucidates parameters from entry points to exclusion lists, teaching a masterclass on how to drive the `gptdocwriter`. Whether you're generating for an audience of JavaScript aficionados or TypeScript connoisseurs, you can customize the performance to perfection.

## Example Commands

Beneath the core script lies an encore of example commands, instilling in users the courage to face the tempest of their own command line. It's a booster shot of confidence, reassuring you that, yes, even mere mortals can wield the power of automatic documentation.

In essence, `gptdocument.js` is your loyal conductor, swinging its wand to and fro, passionately pouring its soul into every note (or file, if you will). It beseeches you to press Enter and behold as your terminal transforms into an amphitheater of anthology generation, for it's not just a script but a performance by the code virtuoso within you. Now, stand back and let the documentation recital commence! (And remember, no intermission cookies allowed near the keyboard.)
