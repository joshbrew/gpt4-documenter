# GPT4-Documenter CLI Utility Documentation

## Overview

`gptdocument.js` is a command-line utility script for generating project documentation. The script interfaces with a set of utilities from `utils.js` to automate the process of documentation generation. Importantly, this script allows configuration of several aspects such as entry points, file types to include, and exclusions.

## Usage

To use this script, ensure it has execution permissions and is invoked from the command line:

```bash
chmod +x gptdocument.js    # Make the script executable
./gptdocument.js           # Run the script
```

## Configuration

The utility parses command-line arguments `args` that allow it to be configured as follows:

- `apiKey`: Setting the API key for the library if required
- `entryPoint`: The path of the directory where the documentation generation should commence
- `initialFiles`: An array of initial file paths to consider for documentation
- `extensions`: An array of file extensions to include in the documentation process
- `excluded`: An array of directory names or file paths to exclude from the documentation process

## Command-Line Arguments

The script can take various arguments to customize its execution:

```bash
./gptdocument.js --apiKey YOUR_API_KEY                       # Set the API key
./gptdocument.js --entryPoint ./src                         # Set the entry point to `./src`
./gptdocument.js --initialFiles file1.js,file2.js           # Set initial files
./gptdocument.js --extensions .js,.ts                       # Set file extensions to include
./gptdocument.js --excluded node_modules,dist               # Set directories or files to exclude
```

## Functionality

### Setting an API Key

If the `apiKey` option is provided, it notifies the user that the API key is being set and saved to the library's install location. This may imply additional functionality elsewhere in the library that persists this API key.

### Documentation Generation

If not setting an API key, then `gptdocument.js` primarily focuses on invoking the `generateDocumentation` function with the appropriate arguments:

- Converts string arguments for `initialFiles`, `extensions`, and `excluded` into arrays if they are not already.
- Sets default values for arguments if they are not provided through the command line:
    - Default `entryPoint` is the current working directory.
    - Default `extensions` include JavaScript `.js`, TypeScript `.ts`, `.mjs`, `.jsx`, and `.tsx` files.
    - Default `excluded` directories are `dist` and `node_modules`.

## Dependencies

This script depends on `utils.js` which should export the `generateDocumentation` function and the `args` argument parser.

```javascript
import {generateDocumentation, args} from './utils.js';
```

## Potential Improvements

- Better error handling and feedback for the user on incorrect or incomplete command usage.
- Enhanced documentation for `generateDocumentation` function and the structure of arguments it accepts.
- Additional details to describe the process of setting the API key and how it's utilized by the library.

## Notes

The script is expected to act as a simple, adaptable CLI wrapper around a more complex documentation generation logic defined in `utils.js`. As the script checks for `args.apiKey` before processing documentation-related arguments, it is important to ensure correct argument parsing and conditional logic flow to align with intended behavior.

Before deployment or serious usage, users should ensure that the full documentation generation process matches their project requirements and that all necessary configurations are provided.
