# `gptdocument.js`

The `gptdocument.js` file acts as the entry point for the GPT Doc Writer command-line interface (CLI). The script initializes the documentation generation process by importing the `generateDocumentation` function and the `args` object from `utils.js`. It handles parameter parsing, converts user inputs from strings to arrays where needed, and kicks off the documentation process or sets the API key if specified.

---

## Usage

Being a CLI tool, `gptdocument.js` is designed to be called directly from the terminal. Here is how you can use it with various options:

```bash
# Set the API key
gptdocwriter --apiKey sk-abcdefg

# Generate documentation with default settings
gptdocwriter

# Generate documentation with custom entry point and file extensions
gptdocwriter --entryPoint path/to/src --extensions [js,ts,tsx,jsx]

# Exclude certain files or directories
gptdocwriter --excluded [server.js,node_modules,dist]
```

The script will use the current working directory by default, but this can be changed using the `--entryPoint` argument. Other arguments allow you to specify:
- Initial files to document
- File extensions to consider
- Files or folders to exclude
- OpenAI model variants to use
- Additional instructions for the documentation content

### Parameter Conversion

Before calling `generateDocumentation`, the script converts any comma-separated CLI argument strings into arrays. This ensures that lists of files, extensions, and excluded items are properly handled by the documentation generator.

```javascript
if(args.extensions && !Array.isArray(args.extensions)) args.extensions = [args.extensions];
// Similar for args.initialFiles and args.excluded
```

## Concluding Thoughts

When invoking `gptdocwriter`, think of it as sending up a flare over the desolate expanse of your project directory, signaling the AI to swoop in like a caffeine-powered developer and document everything it sees. Use this power wisely, and may your documentation be forever up-to-date and comprehensibleâ€”fingers crossed.

If you find any part of it as clear as the last TPS report before the weekend, feel free to throw an office chair at the nearest whiteboard in frustration. Or maybe just pass better CLI arguments.

Now, please excuse the script. It has other projects to overcomplicate.
