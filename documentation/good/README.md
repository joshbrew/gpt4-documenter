## The GPT Doc Writer Promise

üåü *To maintain the sanity of developers drowned in undocumented code.* üåü

Unleash the full potential of your code with documentation that sparkles. May the force of CTRL+C and CTRL+V be with you less often.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while GPT Doc Writer is powered by AI, it is still susceptible to the occasional hiccup. Always review the generated documentation with human eyes (or, if available, a highly trained capybara).

If you find yourself lost in a *.md file, remember, it's just a doc, not a space-time paradox. Cheers to fewer existential crises! ü•Ç
