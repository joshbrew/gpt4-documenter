# `console.js`

The versatile `console.js` serves as the UI's wardrobe, offering a variety of dashing styles and colors for dressing up text output in the console. Furthermore, it includes a navigation compass for argument parsing. When code runs in the terminal, monotony dons a cloak of invisibility, and even error messages can strut down the runway with boldness.

## Color Definitions

The `colors` object houses an array of styles and color codes that are intended to wrap strings displayed in the console. Here's a peek into the kaleidoscopic closet:

```javascript
export const colors = {
  reset: "\x1b[0m",
  //... additional styles omitted for brevity
  fg: {
    black: "\x1b[30m",
    //... additional foreground colors
  },
  bg: {
    black: "\x1b[40m",
    //... additional background colors
  }
};
```

It resembles a LEGO set for console text: snap on a foreground (fg) or background (bg) piece, assemble with the text, and you've built yourself a colorful console output. Can't find the color 'mauve' in there? It's not missing, it's just coding couture darling.

## The `colorText` Function

The `colorText` function is the swaggering personal stylist of the module, applying the selected color to the provided text:

```javascript
export function colorText(text, color) {
  return colors.fg[color] + text + colors.reset;
}
```

To use this function, simply pass the text and the name of the color. Voila! The console output will now have the emotional range of a Shakespearean actor in full costume.

## The `getArgs` Function

```javascript
export const getArgs = (args = process.argv) => {
  //... argument parsing logic
};
```

This function reads the command line for anything resembling arguments (`--key value` or `key=value`) and herds them into an organized object. It's as if your script went through an existential crisis and is now questioning its very purpose with every passing flag.

### Example Usage of `getArgs`

Imagine running your script like so:

```sh
node script.js --model gpt-3.5-turbo --apiKey sk-123456789
```

The resulting object would be akin to:

```javascript
{
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  apiKey: "sk-123456789"
}
```

Pretty convenient, right? Now your script knows its identity and can connect to OpenAI with a touch of an existential calm.

Wrapping up this unusably nifty `console.js` parade, it's what puts the sass in your console sessions and gives clarity to the maze of terminal commands. Just remember, using colors is like seasoning a steak: a sprinkle adds flavor, but pouring the whole shaker might just get the steak to run away from the plate.
