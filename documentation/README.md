# GPT4-Documenter: The Ultimate Code Documentation Experience 🚀📚

Welcome to the GPT4-Documenter, your new favorite AI-powered sidekick that understands your source code better than a caffeine-fueled developer on the eve of a product launch! 🤖✨ Get ready to transform your wild west of code into a well-maintained library with documentation that even your grandma could follow – because let's face it, clear documentation is rarer than a programmer who loves to write it. 🤷‍♂️📖

## Quick Summary

Transform your codebase into an easily navigable documentation repository with just a few commands. No more digging through ancient scripts written in a caffeine-fueled haze – let GPT4-Documenter turn your "what does this even do?" into "Ah, so THAT's what that does!"

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gpt4-documenter.git    # Clone the repository
cd gpt4-documenter                                             # Navigate into the repository
npm install                                                    # Install dependencies
```

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
./gptdocument.js                                               # Generate documentation
```

This will start the documentation process using the default configuration. If you want to customize your experience (like choosing a better adventure in one of those old gamebooks), here are some handy-dandy flags:

```bash
./gptdocument.js --entryPoint ./src                           # Where to start documenting
./gptdocument.js --initialFiles file1.js,file2.js             # Files to document
./gptdocument.js --extensions .js,.md                         # File types to include
./gptdocument.js --excluded node_modules,dist                 # What to exclude (lest ye be judged by your dependencies)
```

## Snazzy Documentation Directory 🗂️

The GPT4-Documenter crafts each markdown document with the same care as a barista creating latte art. Check out our styling collection:

```
/documentation                     # Documentation home
    ├── server.md                  # Server-level documentation
    ├── gptdocument.md             # CLI utility documentation
    ├── utils.md                   # Utility functions explained
    └── README.md                  # This very README
```

## Installation and Getting Started Guide 🛠️
