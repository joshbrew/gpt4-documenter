## Directory of Markdown Documentation 📁

Behold the opus of our documentation journey:

- [utils.js](./utils.js.md): Your go-to swiss army knife for handling the meat and potatoes of our operations.
- [console.js](./console.js.md): A flair flare, adding zest and color to the monochrome monotony of the console.
- [gptdocument.js](./gptdocument.js.md): The orchestrator assuming the helm, steering the ship through the stormy seas of source code en route to Documentation Island.

## Possible Use Cases 🎯

- **Codebase Documentation**: Generate professional, maintainable markdown documentation for your entire codebase.
- **Learning Tool**: Use the generated comments to better understand existing code, whether it's yours or someone else's spaghetti (no judgment).
- **Open Source Projects**: Make your open-source projects more contributor-friendly with detailed explanations and usage guides.
- **Documentation Validation**: Cross-check auto-generated documentation to ensure completeness and accuracy.
